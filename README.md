# slime_mold_simulation
This project implements a simulation of the slime mold behavior using p5.js, inspired by the movement and pattern formation of real slime molds. The slime molds are represented as particles that leave visual traces on a canvas as they explore their environment, searching for optimal paths and forming organic patterns.
